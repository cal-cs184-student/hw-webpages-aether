		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		
		<!--
		<blockquote>
			Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <code>P</code>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <code>P</code> again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <code>R</code>.
		</blockquote>
		-->

		<blockquote>
			Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? A high <code>ks</code>?
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			With a very low <code>ks</code>, the cloth will be very loose, have more motion, and generally have less stiffness. With a high <code>ks</code>, the cloth will be more rigid, have less motion, and generally have more stiffness. This makes sense since we have springs in between the particles that make up the cloth, and the stiffness of the springs is directly related to the stiffness of the cloth.
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			What about for <code>density</code>?
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Density essentially controls the mass of the cloth. With a very low <code>density</code>, the cloth will be very light and will not deform as much, almost like a sheet of paper. With a high <code>density</code>, the cloth will weigh more, deform more, and generally look similar to the cloth with a low <code>ks</code> spring constant. This is due to the fact that gravity (influenced by mass) directly opposes the spring force (influenced by <code>ks</code>).

				</td>
			  </tr>

		</div>

		<blockquote>
			What about for <code>damping</code>?
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			Damping simulates the loss of energy due to internal friction, allowing the cloth to gradually come to rest without altering the forces acting upon it. With very low <code>damping</code>, the cloth behaves more elastically, bouncing excessively and taking a long time to settle. At moderate <code>damping</code> levels, the cloth loses energy more efficiently, reducing bounce and reaching a resting state more quickly. With high <code>damping</code>, the cloth exhibits minimal bounce and comes to rest smoothly upon reaching the bottom. However, excessive damping can cause the cloth to descend more slowly, as seen with damping levels of 80% and 100%.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		
		<blockquote>
			Describe your implementation of handling collisions with spheres and planes.
		</blockquote>

		For cloth-sphere intersections, we do the following:
		<ol>
			<li>
			  Check if a point mass is inside or intersecting the sphere by comparing the distance from the sphere's center to the point mass with the sphere's radius.
			</li>
			<li>
			  If an intersection is detected (i.e. the distance is less than the radius), project the point mass radially outward to the sphere's surface so that it lies just outside.
			</li>
			<li>
			  Scale the correction vector down by \(1 - f\) to account for friction, and add it to the point mass's <code>last_position</code>.
			</li>
		  </ol>
		  
		  For cloth-plane intersections, we do the following:
		  <ol>
			<li>
			  Determine whether a point mass has crossed from one side of the plane to the other between time steps by using the dot product of the point mass's position and the plane's normal vector. If the signs of the dot products using the current and previous positions are different, a crossing has occurred.
			</li>
			<li>
			  If a crossing is detected, move the point mass to the point of intersection with the plane, offset slightly along the normal vector (by <code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code>) to keep it just above the surface.
			</li>
			<li>
			  Scale the correction vector down by \(1 - f\) to account for friction, and add it to the point mass's <code>last_position</code>.
			</li>
		  </ol>

		<blockquote>
			Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from <code>scene/sphere.json</code> in its final resting state on the sphere using the default <code>ks</code> = 5000 as well as with <code>ks</code> = 500 and <code>ks</code> = 50000. Describe the differences in the results.
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			We see that the smaller the <code>ks</code>, the more the cloth deforms and wraps around the sphere. This is consistent with Part 2, where we observed that a lower <code>ks</code> leads to greater deformation of the cloth. On the other hand, with a higher <code>ks</code>, the cloth does not fully wrap around the sphere. Instead, it loosely covers the sphere, with its springs providing increased rigidity to the cloth.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		
		<blockquote>
			Describe your implementation of handling self-collisions.
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			To efficiently resolve self-collisions in the cloth simulation, I used spatial hashing to group nearby point masses and limit unnecessary pairwise comparisons. The spatial map is built in <code>build_spatial_map()</code> by hashing each point mass's position into a 3D grid cell. The <code>hash_position()</code> function computes this hash by first dividing space into boxes of size <code>w = 3 * width / num_width_points</code>, <code>h = 3 * height / num_height_points</code>, and <code>t = max(w, h)</code> — and then floors  the position coordinates to determine the grid cell. The final hash is calculated as <code>i + j * range + k * range * range</code>, where <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>k</code> are the floored grid indices and <code>range</code> is a large constant (e.g., 100000) to ensure uniqueness.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			During collision resolution in <code>self_collide()</code>, only the point masses within the same cell are checked. If another point mass is within <code>2 * thickness</code>, a correction vector is computed to push the masses apart. This correction is accumulated across all collisions, averaged, and applied to the current point mass's position, scaled by <code>simulation_steps</code> to ensure smooth separation.
			</p>

		<blockquote>
			Show us at least 3 screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the ground).

			Vary the density as well as ks and describe with words and screenshots how they affect the behavior of the cloth as it falls on itself.
		</blockquote>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		
		<blockquote>
			Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			A shader program is a piece of code that is in charge of controlling how objects are drawn on a screen, and it runs in parallel on GPU. The two main shaders used in graphics pipelines are vertex shaders and fragment shaders, and they both work together to create an image in the rendering process.
			<ul>
				<li>
					A vertex shader loops thorugh each vertex of a 3d object. It transform's the vertex into 2d space using matrix projects and passes data along the fragment shader, like texture coordinates, normals, etc. It essentially places the vertices on the screen and gives information to each dot(vertex) that will be used in the fragment shader.
				</li>
				<li>
					A fragemnt shader loops through each pixel that needs to be rendered/drawn. It uses data from each part of the surface given by the vertex shader to calculate the final color of each pixel. The fragment shader is in charge of lighting and material effects, and is in charge of how bright each pixel of the image should be.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>



		<blockquote>
			Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model is a method to simulate how light interacts with surfaces to make them look bright/dull/shiny. It is not an accurate representation of how light creates these effects in the real world. It simply makes 3d objects appear more realistic by treating light in three parts: ambient, diffuse, and specular. 
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					Ambient light is similar to background lighting. It encomasses lighting bouncing around the entire scene and hitting the surface in question basically all directions. It has a glowing feel, in the sense that even parts not directly lit still get a piece of ambient ligth.
				</li>
				<li>
					Diffuse light is strictly light that hits the surface directly, which depends on the angle between light and the surface's normal. The bigger the cosine is between the normal and the direction of the directly hit light is, the brighter that spot is. Diffuse light can be seen when you shine a light at a sphere: the light on the sphere grows dimmmer and dimmer from the apex of where the light is shining.
				</li>
				<li>
					Specular light is the light you find on glossy or like shiny surfaces. This is calculated using a halfway vector, which measures if the halfway vector between the incoming light direction and the viewing direction is aligned with the surface normal. The highlight intensity depends on how close the normal vector and the halfway vector are.
				</li>
			</ul>
